Title: The Industrialization of Prompt Engineering: From Experimentation to Scalable Infrastructure

I. Introduction
    A. The Shifting Landscape of AI (2023-2025)
        1. Early stages: Exploratory, manual prompt tuning
        2. Current state: Industrial-scale infrastructure, automated workflows
    B. Rationale for Industrialization
        1. Growing demand for AI-generated content
        2. Need for consistency, quality, and cost-efficiency
        3. Limitations of manual prompt engineering at scale
    C. Overview of the "Self-Governing Content Ecosystem"
        1. Definition and core principles
        2. How it addresses current challenges
        3. Roadmap for the course: practical system design through product implementation

II. Foundational Concepts: Tokenomics in Action
    A. What are Tokens?
        1. Beyond words: subword units and BPE (Byte Pair Encoding)
        2. Model-specific tokenizers (e.g., tiktoken for OpenAI)
        3. The critical difference from simple word counts
    B. The Economics of Tokens
        1. API pricing models (input vs. output tokens)
        2. Calculating cost: real-time estimation for large content blocks
        3. Budgeting and cost control in AI-driven systems
    C. Token Density and Context Windows
        1. Maximizing information per token: efficiency and conciseness
        2. Managing context window limits for long-form content
        3. Strategies for chunking, summarization, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
    D. Impact on System Design
        1. Latency considerations for token processing
        2. Rate limiting and quota management
        3. Distributed token estimation services for high-throughput environments

III. Designing the Automated Content Editor (Conceptual Overview for the Course)
    A. Core Components
        1. Prompt Orchestration Engine: Dynamic prompt generation
        2. Content Generation Modules: Specialized LLM interactions
        3. Quality Assurance & Refinement: Automated feedback loops
        4. User Interface/API Layer: Integration points
    B. Data Flow and Control Flow
        1. User/System input -> Outline generation -> Content generation -> Review
        2. Integration of tokenomics checks at each stage
    C. Resilience and Scalability
        1. Handling LLM API failures and retries
        2. Horizontal scaling for concurrent content generation
        3. Monitoring and observability for performance and cost

IV. Practical Implementation: Day 1 Focus - Building the Token Estimator
    A. Setting up the environment (Python, virtualenv, tiktoken)
    B. Implementing the `estimate_tokens_and_cost` function
    C. Integrating with our sample long-form outline
    D. Interpreting the results: token count and estimated cost

V. Conclusion
    A. Recap of Tokenomics importance
    B. The path forward: building out the content ecosystem
    C. Next steps: assignment and preparation for future modules
